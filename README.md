# disassembler-assignments: Disassembler Assignments
##  Disassembler Utility Functions, and <br> Working Disassember

### Disassembler Utility Functions
This repository contains the starter code (including a `Makefile` and a
template test file) for a program in which students will write and
test two functions (`verifyMIPSInstruction` and `binToDec`).  These
functions will be useful in the Disassembler program to be written later.
(See [here](http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs230/Projects/DisUtilitiesProj.html)
for the project description for this program.)

### Working Disassembler
The repository also contains some additional starter code for the
full disassembler program.
(See [here](http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs230/Projects/DisassemblerProj.html)
for the project description for the full disassembler program.)
